The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
ST 'STM32F407VG' microcontroller using ST 'STM32F4-Discovery' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =             8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           168.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 168.00 MHz


The example simulates a step-motor driver.
Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32F407 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F407 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)
